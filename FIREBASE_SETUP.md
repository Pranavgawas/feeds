### 🚀 How to Use:

#### For Users:
1. Click "Continue with Google" on the login page
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create posts (they will be pending approval)
4. View your posts in "My Posts"
5. View approved posts in "Community Posts"
6. Update or delete your own posts

#### For Admins:
1. First, manually set a user as admin in Firebase Console:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
   - Find the user in the `users` collection
   - Set `isAdmin: true` for that user
2. Admin can access special admin page to approve/delete posts

### 📊 Database Structure:

#### Users Collection: `/users/{userId}`
```javascript
{
  uid: "user_id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  displayName: "User Name",
  photoURL: "https://...",
  isAdmin: false,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Posts Collection: `/posts/{postId}`
```javascript
{
  userId: "user_id",
  content: "Post content text",
  displayName: "User Name",
  status: "pending", // or "approved"
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### 🔐 Important: Deploy Firestore Rules

To deploy the security rules to Firebase:

```bash
cd firebase-feed-app
firebase login
firebase init  # If you haven't initialized Firebase CLI
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
